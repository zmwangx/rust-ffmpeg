This is a fork of the abandoned [ffmpeg](https://crates.io/crates/ffmpeg) crate
by [meh.](https://github.com/meh/rust-ffmpeg).

This crate is currently in maintenance mode, and aims to be compatible with all
of FFmpeg's versions from 3.4 (currently from 3.4 til 8.0)

Build instructions can be found on the
[wiki](https://github.com/zmwangx/rust-ffmpeg/wiki/Notes-on-building).

### Static linking on macOS (Homebrew)

When the `static` feature is enabled, `ffmpeg-sys-next` calls
`pkg-config --static --libs`, which expands `Libs.private` from Homebrew's
`libavcodec.pc`. That file lists transitive dependencies as bare `-l` flags
(e.g. `-lmp3lame`) without the corresponding `-L` paths, and omits `-lc++` even
though static x265/libvmaf objects are C++. The final link therefore fails with
errors like `ld: library 'mp3lame' not found`.

Homebrew does not officially support static linking, so add a build script
(`build.rs`) in your crate to patch the search paths and libc++.

Skip this when using a self-contained static FFmpeg (e.g. vcpkg):

```rust
fn main() {
    #[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
    if std::env::var_os("VCPKG_ROOT").is_none() {
        let mut paths = Vec::new();
        if let Some(prefix) = std::env::var_os("HOMEBREW_PREFIX") {
            paths.push(std::path::PathBuf::from(prefix).join("lib"));
        }
        paths.push(std::path::PathBuf::from("/opt/homebrew/lib"));
        paths.push(std::path::PathBuf::from("/usr/local/lib"));
        paths.sort();
        paths.dedup();
        for path in paths {
            if path.exists() {
                println!("cargo:rustc-link-search=native={}", path.display());
            }
        }
        println!("cargo:rustc-link-lib=dylib=c++");
    }
}
```

_Note on upgrading to v4.3.4 or later: v4.3.4 introduced automatic FFmpeg
version detection, obsoleting feature flags `ffmpeg4`, `ffmpeg41`, `ffmpeg42`
and `ffmpeg43`. If you manually specify any of these features, now is the time
to remove them; if you use `ffmpeg43` through the `default` feature, it's still
on for backward-compatibility but it has turned into a no-op, and you don't need
to do anything. Deprecation plan: `ffmpeg43` will be dropped from default
features come 4.4, and all these features will be removed come 5.0._

_See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for other information on version upgrades._

A word on versioning: major and minor versions of this crate track major and
minor versions of FFmpeg, e.g. 4.2.x of this crate has been updated to support
the 4.2.x series of FFmpeg. Patch level is reserved for changes to this crate
and does not track FFmpeg patch versions. Since we can only freely bump the
patch level, versioning of this crate differs from semver: minor versions may
behave like semver major versions and introduce backward-incompatible changes;
patch versions may behave like semver minor versions and introduce new APIs.
Please peg the version you use accordingly.

**Please realize that this crate is in maintenance-only mode for the most
part.** Which means I'll try my best to ensure the crate compiles against all
release branches of FFmpeg 3.4 and later (only the latest patch release of each
release branch is officially supported) and fix reported bugs, but if a new
FFmpeg version brings new APIs that require significant effort to port to Rust,
you might have to send me a PR (and just to be clear, I can't really guarantee
I'll have the time to review). Any PR to improve existing API is unlikely to be
merged, unfortunately.

🤝 **If you have significant, demonstrable experience in Rust and
multimedia-related programming, please let me know, I'll be more than happy to
invite you as a collaborator.** 🤝
